The idea behind the feature is to scrape and mine social sites from around the web to make connections between people that wouldnt otherwise exists and share that information with people who wouldnt otherwise have access to it. All of this happens without the knowledge, consent or control of the people whose information is being shared. Here is how Google Social Circles works:1) Googles robots scour the web for peoples social connections on different websites. These connections are then stored in a collection peoples connections on different websites. This collection is then mined, creating connections between people on different websites, that those people never intended and cant control.2) This information is then shared with anyone who has a Google account, whether it is Gmail, Chat or another Google service that includes a personal profile -- more than 146 million people have Gmail accounts alone, and some estimates say as many as 400 million people have at least one Google account.3) Google Social Circles automatically enables people to trace their contacts\' connections and profile information by crawling and scraping the sites you and your contacts use, like Twitter, MySpace, YouTube, Facebook, Yelp, Yahoo and many others, likely in direct violation of the Terms of Service for those sites, unless those sites have partnered with Google on this service, something else users ought to be aware of.4) Even if you are not a Google account holder, your information is still mined, stored and shared as long as you have some connection on any site Google scrapes to someone who has a Google account. You dont even have to have a direct connection to the person with a Google account. If someone you are connected to is connected with someone with a Google account, your information will be shared.5) To find out if your own Social Circles direct and secondary connections that Google has indexed to your account, visit: http://www.google.com/s2/u/0/search/social#socialcircle, and https://profiles.google.com/u/0/connectedaccountsPrivacy ViolationsThe ability to abuse this information and violate the privacy rights of millions of Americans is clear:No notice: Google does not notify people that their information is being used in a way that the person would not expectto connect different groups of people within an Internet-wide database Google created.No consent: Google Social Circles does not ask permission from individuals who will have their profiles, connections and other personal data shared in the new network. Google will simply scrape their information from dozens of sources and compile the data into one massive dossier aligned directly with users personally identifiable information.No control: On all of the sites Google scrapes, you can change your mind. You can delete your account. You can make or break connections to other people. How do you remove this information from the database that Google is sharing with hundreds of millions of people? You cant.Serious real world risks: Google is taking different parts of peoples livesparts they deliberately separated onto different sitesand presenting the collage Google created to other people.
