It will also become the team\'s new logo: http://i.imgur.com/nc6Av.jpg Winter is here and so are we, to present Team GhostShell\'s last project. We\'ve included plenty of surprises in this one, so hop on our bandwagon, we\'re going on an adventure! #ProjectWhiteFox will conclude this year\'s series of attacks by promoting hacktivism worldwide and drawing attention to the freedom of information on the net. For those two factors we have prepared a juicy release of 1.6 million accounts/records from fields such as aerospace, nanotechnology, banking, law, education, government, military, all kinds of wacky companies & corporations working for the department of defense, airlines and more. But before that, we need to talk a bit about a recent event that occurred and is/should be of great interest to everyone that uses the internet. The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) is hosting a meeting right now that may very well decide the fate of how the inet will be managed in the future. Basically the UN may very well give total power to the ITU on how to handle everything. Anonymous has already initiated an operation on the matter called #OpWCIT (Operation World Conference on International Telecommunications.) Follow for more news here: https://twitter.com/opWCIT & http://twitter.com/OpBigBrother More details on it here: http://anoncentral.tumblr.com/post/36801416122/opwcit-poster-internet-freedom-demands And here: http://www.anonpaste.me/anonpaste2/index.php?5b84abc77518c319#3UiELYLx5G00wG9Q765qdkCysEpjET+sPSGV5S28j9Y= Also, one of the many flyers out there for it: http://anonymissexpress.cyberguerrilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/opwict-715x1024.jpg The initiative for preventing the internet from turning into a governmental police-state has already begun by getting different websites/companies to \'deface\' their own site with a message about it and why they\'re against it. GhostShell is encouraging this phenomenon as well. If you\'re liking this idea, feel free to do it too, regardless of who you are. Spreading the message and informing people about it is what matters. __________________________ \'Kay, let\'s get this party started! ESA, NASA, Pentagon, Federal Reserve, Interpol, FBI try to keep up from here on out because it\'s about to get interesting. Since it\'s our final stand this year, we\'ve made the call to invite you guys to our event as well. How? Well, how about by starting with the fact that anti-terror agencies have been keeping an eye on us from the beginning. GlobalTerrorAlert you and the rest thought were invisible just because your own websites were set to \'hidden\'? Silly kids, if you\'re on the net, then you can be sure that someone is watching you, no matter how hard you try to hide. How did we find you? How did we find everyone else? Easy. You\'re predictable: http://i.imgur.com/Y8Sub.png "DeadMellox" was a ghost to begin with. Never existed. No, really. Before we created "him", he never exited on the internet, zero searches on google and all that jazz. Starting to get it now? We used the name afterwards to trackback all mentions of that name all over the place. Well, the whole plan is a bit more complicated than that, part of a bigger story, but let\'s leave it at that for now. Flashpoint Intel was one of the hotspots that you guys were using to make your own docs on hackers. But, guess what: flashpoint-intel.com/news.php?id=12 Lame security. Interesting fact is that we weren\'t the only ones in there doing espionage. It really was fascinating to see how everything developed all these months. How we went from \'cyber-criminals\' to \'hacktivists\' to \'e-terrorists\' to \'bad actors\' to blacklisted. #ProjectHellFire got the US wary of us, at that time we still weren\'t sure if GhostShell had gotten X\'d, but when the second release of #ProjectWestWind came out, you guys got so hyped about it that we knew it had started to unfold. With the help of ChillingEffects you proceeded to delete any and all mentions of us from the net. www.chillingeffects.org/notice.cgi?sID=29371 (CGI exploits FTW.) How did that work out for you? Being blacklisted sure is nice. USA, China, Russia, u mad? We get special treatment and everything. Of course that means that all public files from different security firms will also become private and everything will be discussed behind closed doors. Isn\'t that right Verizon? Riiiight: Part 1: http://i.imgur.com/hwzmw.png Part 2: http://i.imgur.com/VTCUz.png How intriguing that after, all those propaganda medias and government statements went from "they are a threat" to "nevermind, it\'s nothing" and everything got either retracted or covered shortly after. Even the japanese media does it: http://i.imgur.com/u6olO.png Even their 43 second video gets set to private in the end. THAT\'S how big this got. We\'ve been keeping tabs on these things for quite a while now. It\'s not that hard to inject malware in gov\'s and spy a little: http://i.imgur.com/lDgVi.png Neither is it to do a little search and find how cyber security firms such as BericoTechnologies like to hang around stackoverflow: http://i.imgur.com/m7feh.png It\'s funny actually; private investigators use social platforms to find their suspects, yet here we are doing it to "experts". Lame. Speaking of lame, people might want to look into Raytheon and see how "pro" military sponsored cyber teams really are. Keep on coding in that x86 assembly fellas, ruby scripts r zeh best, amirate?! We sent SANS a message too through a different path. No point in getting Imperva involved though, they release every year the same report on \'big heckers\' from HF on how they debate which anime they should watch next. Joke of a security company, can\'t even find a real black-market. ZOMG! Can\'t believe they even baited the clues we left on purpose in HellFire. Just keep doing what you guys do best, and that is, blog. Ok, moving on to finalize this little rant, we know of your people working in the media (NBC suck a dick plz), of your snitches from Anon networks, the whiteasshats that inhabit it, idling and lurking like real pro "security experts", although no one really told them that there\'s no such thing as security and the expert part is cracking us up every time. Instead of wasting their lives posting troll comments on every possible comment box out there, talking about how all hacktivists are criminals and "script kiddies" while bragging about their amazing talents even though they don\'t even know how to update their own pgp key\\s (busted manyyyy times lol), they\'re better off learning something new about this game. Well considering how the majority of \'security\' forums out there have most of their threads about \'how to install windows xp\', no wonder law enforcement agencies stalk underaged kids on the internet to find newblood. So, hackers and hacktivists alike, don\'t tremble, don\'t over think things too much. Do what you want to do and give 0fucks always. Their only weapons are ProjectHoneyPot and metasploit. rofl We had an interesting encounter at the beginning of this year, when we hacked the EU\'s official website and being sloppy & lazy at the time we forgot to password one of our ghostbox\'s and Interpol/EU Officials backtraced it. After seeing how it was empty, they deleted it and ragequit. lmao Alright, story time over. We wanted to share some of TeamGhostShell\'s adventures with everyone since this is the last one for 2012. For more details check out the last part of the release for a full mention of all our hacks this year. ____________________________________ We\'ve sent an email (from deadmellox@tormail.org) to the following: ICS-CERT Security Operations Center (ics-cert@dhs.gov) Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) (hsin.helpdesk@dhs.gov) Lessons Learned and Information Sharing (LLIS) (feedback@llis.dhs.gov) FBI - Washington Division (washington.field@ic.fbi.gov) FBI - Seattle (seattle.fbi@ic.fbi.gov) Flashpoint Intel Partners (info@flashpoint-intel.com) Raytheon (products@raytheon.com) Since NASA is also mentioned there, we also sent it to (m.sepp@larc.nasa.gov) which turned out to be the email address of Langley: http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/about/contact.html And finally to (m.copeland@larc.nasa.gov) who apparently is working for the Technical Reports Servers.

A general project used for all sorts of operations, the first one was in retaliation to the arrests of hackers that happened at the beginning of the year. It was mistaken, that this was it\'s true purpose or the true purpose of the team. http://techtalk.seattle.gov/2012/04/17/team-ghostshell-hacks-university-of-arkansas-computer-store/ A second target appeared after, this time in Europe: http://www.cyberwarnews.info/2012/05/08/the-european-forex-traders-hacked-by-teamghostshell/ A third one in Asia, China: http://www.cyberwarnews.info/2012/05/08/hangzhou-dianzi-university-hacked-150000-accounts-leaked-by-_echel0n-deadmellox/ These three attacks would later symbolize the pattern that Team GhostShell would take throughout the year, North/South America, Europe and Asia. More attacks followed from all over the world, mostly governmental based: http://www.cyberwarnews.info/2012/06/12/social-action-secretariat-hacked-accounts-leaked-by-teamghostshell/ http://www.cyberwarnews.info/2012/06/12/seprelad-hacked-data-leaked-by-teamghostshell/ http://www.cyberwarnews.info/2012/06/12/high-commission-of-india-hackeddata-leaked-by-teamghostshell/ http://www.cyberwarnews.info/2012/06/12/16-further-government-sites-hacked-by-teamghostshell/ When the time came to launch a real cyberwar upon China, #ProjectDragonFly was born: http://freakoutnation.com/2012/06/01/hello-china-teamghostshell-is-breaching-your-sites-with-a-vengeance-meet-opdragonfly/ This was decided right after the fall of Anonymous China. We regret that the one in charge there was arrested, but, hey, it happens even to the best of us. AC trusted us with finding ways of taking down the GFA. At the time we had found two ways of doing it, the only thing left to do was get the right equipment for it. After the bust, everything was put on hold. The whole thing was for "Freedom of Speech in China". Since the country is still engraved in communism, everyone that speaks against the party, gets put down. We provided examples etc. in the release at the time. Later on, a second release happened alongside the first project (http://www.cyberwarnews.info/2012/07/04/300000-personal-details-leaked-38-sites-hacked-for-projectdragonfly/), this time it was also meant as a reply towards VenusTech, that got really butthurt on us for causing so much damage in the first place. Someone on the inside said that the university target might\'ve caused more than 70 mil. $\'s alone. We never got to finding out for sure, but hey, at least it was lulzy. In the meantime, #ProjectWestWind happened. The first original release: http://www.bitdefender.com/security/Italian-Government-Websites-Defaced-by-GhostShell-Hacker-Group.html Hacking government officials that were right-wing extremists/racists from all over Europe. A point had to be made. By this point, GhostShell began handling so much data in the backstage that we felt the need to extend and what better way of doing that than branching on certain categories. Around the middle of July, MidasBank came to life, as our financial sector. And to commemorate it\'s rise, a symbolic release was carried out: The target we chose, was WallStreet: http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9229336/Hacker_claims_breach_of_50_000_accounts_from_Wall_Street_IT_recruiting_firm It\'s reason behind it was as support for the Occupy WallStreet movement. Right before you just thought that summer had ended, we came back with #ProjectHellFire at the end of August. http://www.cyberwarnews.info/2012/08/26/cia-mit-governments-businesses-100-sites-hacked-accounts-leaked/ We had previously gotten so many positive messages about #ProjectGhostShell and the on-going abuse hackers go through after getting caught, that we made the call to create a project just to raise awareness for that. They got the message alright: http://www.sytech-consultants.com/blog/tag/project-hellfire The whole thing spread like wildfire and it became the first step to us being blacklisted. Part 1: http://i.imgur.com/OOCKo.png Part 2: http://i.imgur.com/sWiam.png In this one, OphiusLab (the science and technology branch) came to life and it leveled with the rest of us by breaching MIT, among others. One month later, after postponing our cyberwar in the Middle East, we rolled with a new release from #ProjectWestWind. This time against the school policies that had spiked tuition fees, outdated reforms and unprepared school faculty, it was meant as a huge wakeup call for politicians worldwide: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/hacktivists-college-records-dump-team-ghostshell_n_1940388.html In this release we cordially invited members of Anonymous to participate on talks about "today\'s education" and how they viewed it. The opinions were put in the leak at the beginning. What followed afterwards, was absolute carnage. #ProjectBlackStar was next to happen. Fought with the same ideals behind it such as "Freedom of Speech", like in China\'s case, it became eventually side-lined by Russia\'s spying game. We felt the need to point it out too, considering how the whole country is in a bad state yet the government has enough money to spend on it\'s "stealing" activities rather than focusing on making an honest business to profit from. It needed to be said that it didn\'t matter how much data they stole from other countries, in the end Team GhostShell would still have more than them and to prove our point the leak was made: http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/11/02/hacker-group-ghostshell-declares-war-on-russia-leaks-2-5-million-alleged-accounts-and-records/ The rest is history...and the year ends for us with #ProjectWhiteFox.
